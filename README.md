# Employee_Tracker

In this challenge, we were required to use JavaScript and MySQL to create a terminal application for an Employee Tracker

This application allows businesses to manage their staff but viewing, updating, and creating new employees, roles, and departments.

The user is presented with prompts for all different the different sections of the application and they can scroll through and choose which section they would like to utilize. 

This was our first time using MySQL and it was used to create tables and seeds of data for our JavaScript to access and present to the user in the form of prompts. 

Overall, I am satisfied with the challenges demands and my introduction into mySQL. It is very useful to organize and setup data to be displayed to the user.
